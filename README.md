This is a web-based Client Tracker application designed to streamline client progress tracking with easy-to-use features.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up, run, and test the application.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Joshua11l/client-tracking-systems.git>
```
### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash

```

### Run the Application

Start the development server with:
```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

The page will reload whenever you make edits. You may also see errors and warnings in the console.

### Testing the Application

Enter these credentials on the login page to access the app.

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for managing the application:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details, see the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build process optimizes the app for best performance by minifying the code and including hashes in the filenames. The app is ready to be deployed.

For more details, refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation and is not reversible. This command copies the configuration files and dependencies directly into your project folder, giving you full control over the configuration.

Use this only if you need to customize the build process. All commands except `eject` will continue to work as before.
